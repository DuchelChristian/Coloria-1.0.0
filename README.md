# Coloria-1.0.0
We are going to Create a Chrome Extension allowing us to get the hex code for any color on our screen(tab).

We are following a tutorial provided by coding Nepal but we are going to bring our own modifications to his program
The manifest is what makes this whole project an extension, we gave the name of the extension Coloria, its version 1.0.0, we are using the 3rd version of manifest as the second one will soon no longer be supported, we already linked it to a html file called popup that we are yet to create, and also added our icon to it.
